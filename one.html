                <h3>Brief History:</h3>
                <p>
                    Three villages namely Kalikata, Gobindpur and Sutanati together constitute the city of Kolkata located on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River. During the 13th century, trade with foreign land flourished in the region. In 1686, Job Charnock, the founder of Kolkata, started the East India Company factory at Sutanati as part of the expansion plan in British India. Kolkata is believed to have its name from the village Kalikata. However, there are other views. The most populous belief is that the city is named after the Hindu Goddess, “Kali”. In 1972, Warren Hasting, the First Governor General of British India announced Kolkata as the capital of British India and renamed it Calcutta. Calcutta remained the capital of British India until 1911. In 2001, Calcutta was again renamed back to its original name Kolkata.
